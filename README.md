# 🏄🏻‍♀️ Extreme Dashboard Makeover 🪂

In this Grafana Labs hands-on workshop, we'll take a boring dashboard and transform it into a visually appealing and informative one. This is a great way to learn about Grafana's features, improve your dashboard design skills, and have fun in the process!

## Requirements:
- A Grafana instance (Cloud or OSS)
- The built-in TestData data source
- A modern web browser
- Your creativity and enthusiasm!

## Getting Started
If you don't already have a Grafana instance we recommend using the Killercoda track that provides you a Grafana OSS instance with the data source and dashboards already imported. Click the URL below to launch a new lab instance in a browser tab.

If you're using your own Grafana instance simply import the Overdrive.json dashboard from the Labs folder and add connect it to your TestData data source.
